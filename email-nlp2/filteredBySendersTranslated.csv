Information To comply with the stringent information security restrictions of the offices we have received permission to add another team member who specializes in information security. The member will be an integral part of the group and will receive a certificate of participation in the project on behalf of Google Anyone interested should contact Oran Shemesh Oranshemesh gmail com"
